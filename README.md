## Topics Learned

- **Creating app structure:** What are the things we need for our project
- **Creating project folders:** Creating Folders, installing the necessary dependencies.
- **Creating a model:** We create a Model for our App which consists of what are the items/properties need in our project. we are doing this because it will save a lot of time and it is pretty much useful.
- **Creating services and using them:** We Generate services, through which any change made in the App is get effected. By using services and deriving what it should do, it will get easier to implement some things in our components.
- **Recative form:** Angular has basically two types of forms **Reactive Forms** and **Template-driven Forms**. we are using _Reactive Forms_ here. For detailed info about them visit [Forms](https://angular.io/guide/forms-overview).
